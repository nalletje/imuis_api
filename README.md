# Project
This project is dedicated to connect to the iMuis cloudswitch API.
More info about iMuis           ::  https://www.muis.nl
Documentation from cloudswitch  ::  http://cswdoc.imuisonline.com

At this moment we only support GetStamTabelRecords && CreateVerkoopOrder!

# Current version
At this moment, you can use this API to get data from your iMuis database and create a invoice.
We have some pre-defined settings for Debitors, Articles (products), Order Sorts and Create Order. More will follow in the future.

# Usage
It is pretty easy to use, see the folder Examples for more information

# Install
      composer require nalletje/imuis_api

# Credits
All credits go to https://github.com/Opifer/Imuis/
Since his branch is not up-to-date and not (fully) working with PHP 7.2, i started this project.
